# Structural-Design-of-Bituminous-Road-Pavement-using-IITPave-Software
Performed structural design of bituminous pavements using IITPave software by applying layered elastic theory. Conducted stressâ€“strain analysis, evaluated fatigue and rutting criteria, and optimized layer thicknesses for durable, cost-effective, and standard-compliant pavement structures.
