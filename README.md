# Structural Design of Bituminous Road Pavement using IITPave Software

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the **structural design of flexible bituminous pavements** using IITPave software. The methodology applies **layered elastic theory** to evaluate stresses, strains, and deflections in pavement layers under traffic loading. 

## Objectives
- Determine optimal layer thicknesses to withstand traffic over the design life.
- Evaluate fatigue and rutting criteria for performance-based design.
- Achieve a balance between construction cost and long-term durability.

## Process
1. Data collection – traffic (ESALs), material properties, environmental conditions.
2. Pavement layer configuration – subgrade, base, sub-base, and bituminous surface.
3. Stress–strain analysis – tensile strain at asphalt bottom, compressive strain at subgrade.
4. Design optimization – iterative adjustments for fatigue resistance and cost balance.
5. Verification – validation against performance standards.

## Applications
This project demonstrates **pavement design principles** for highways, enabling engineers to create durable, cost-effective road structures suitable for real-world conditions.
